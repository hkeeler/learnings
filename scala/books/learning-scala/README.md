### Notes

1. Installing Scala

        $ brew install scala
        $ scala -version
        Scala code runner version 2.11.4 -- Copyright 2002-2013, LAMP/EPFL

### Exercises

1. Although println() is a good way to print a string, can you find a way to print a string without println? Also, what kinds of numbers, strings, and other data does the REPL support?

2. In the Scala REPL, convert the temperature value of 22.5 Centigrade to Fahrenheit. The conversion formula is cToF(x) = (x * 9/5) + 32.

3. Take the result from exercise 2, halve it, and convert it back to Centigrade. You can use the generated constant variable (e.g., “res0”) instead of copying and pasting the value yourself.

4. The REPL can load and interpret Scala code from an external file with the :load <file> command. Create a new file named Hello.scala and add a command that will print a greeting, then execute it from the REPL.

5. Another way to load external Scala code is to paste it into the REPL in “raw” mode, where the code is compiled as if it were actually in a proper source file. To do this, type :paste -raw, hit Return, and then paste the contents of your source file from exercise 4. After exiting “paste” mode you should see the greeting.
